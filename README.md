<h1>Multilanguage Handwritten Text recognition and conversion in Speech and vice versa</h1>

<p>The aim of this project is to automate the application to get beyond the language barrier between nations and also between states within a nation. The aforementioned application will carry out all of the features of the application. The application may translate voice from one language to another user-defined language so that people can express themselves clearly. It provides audio of the translated language and has four modules, including speech synthesis, translation, image translation, and voice recognition. The application accepts written material as well and translates it into the appropriate language. The application can translate the text into the desired language and display the translation on the user's screen after it has identified the text in the image that was stored on the system or acquired using a camera.
</p>

<p>The language barrier is an issue for effective communication nowadays, which is why we developed this application. In order to understand the language spoken by the user during communication, voice recognition and text translation are mostly used to convert speech to text and text to speech. As a result, a person can recognise speech that is said by another person. OCR technology is employed in the translation of images into text. OCR is a method for extracting text from images, including handwritten writing, signboards, and other types of images. The language of statements that are translated into images is understood via this picture extraction.
</p>
<p>The use of mobile devices has greatly expanded. Many applications are created for mobile users, including text-to-voice, speech recognition, multilingual translation, and text extraction. Similar applications, however, are not created for PC users. We are developing a single application that combines all of the aforementioned applications.</p>
<p>
the main goal is to integrate all of the various functions, including speech recognition, text translation, text synthesis, and text extraction from images, into one seamless application.

<h3>System Architecture</h3>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>For our system, there are four interconnected modules: text to speech, speech to text, image extraction, and language translator.</p>

<h5>1 - Text to Speech</h5>
 <p>The primary goal of a text-to-speech system is to turn any chosen or randomly selected text into speech. By concatenating recorded speech that is stored in a database, speech can be produced as an output.</p>
<p>There are primarily two parts: first, the processing of the input text, and second, the conversion of the text to speech. Speech synthesis is the term used to describe the process of turning text into speech, and the computer system utilised for this is known as a speech synthesiser. It is primarily consists of two activities, text normalisation and tokenization. Each word is given a phonetic transcription using this procedure. Put it into clauses, sentences, and phrases.</p>

<h5>Text to speech conversion</h5>

<h5>Speech to text</h5>

<h3>conclusion</h3>
<p>In this proposed system, we implemented the system for user who phasing problems of language barrier and also it user interface is also user friendly so that user can easily interact with this system . So because of this system don't have to use dictionary for understanding the meaning of word, so it automatically reduce the user task for understanding the languages for communication.</p>
